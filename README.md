# Like Counter

The likes counter was created based on the need to count countless data in a spreadsheet. Within the company, employees sent likes in the form of cards to other employees congratulating them on some achievement, these cards are converted to a spreadsheet, so the Likes Counter arose from this need to count how many likes each member sent and received and the program fulfills the role of automating this process.
